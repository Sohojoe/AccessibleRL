# AccessibleRL

The goal of this site is to create 'screen readable' notes for my studies on Reinforement Learning.

I'm dyslexic and use text to voice for dense text - however, every online course and acedemic paper fail when using a screen reader.

So, this site uses a couple of tricks:

1. Writing out formula phonetically. For example:

$$\huge{G_t \doteq R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + ... + R_{T}}$$
$$\space$$
$$\text{(G at timestep t, is equivalent to, R, at t+1, +, R, at t+2, + R, at t+3, +, etc)}$$

2. Using KaTeX to render math which seams to perform better in browsers espectially the Chromium versions of Microsoft Edge.



Alternative example to check rendering

$$\huge{G_t \doteq R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + ... + R_{T}}$$
