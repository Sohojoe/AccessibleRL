# AccessibleRL

The goal of this site is to create 'screen readable' notes for my studies on Reinforement Learning.

I'm dyslexic and use text to voice for dense text - however, every online course and acedemic paper fail when using a screen reader.

So, this site uses a couple of tricks:

1. Writing out formula phonetically. For example:

$$
G_t \doteq R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + ... + R_{T}
$$

(G at timestep t, is equivalent to, R, at t+1, +, R, at t+2, + R, at t+3, +, etc)

2. dd
